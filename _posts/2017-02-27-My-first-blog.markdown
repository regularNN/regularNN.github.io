As the title says, this is my first ever blog. I have never been into writing. I do write codes and occasionally improvise documents of my friends but have never been into writing stuff from my mind. 

This is my new experiment to which I remember I wanted to do from a very long time. I wish to write weekly blog about the things I read and things I feel to share. 

To finish this quick short and first blog I would like to share the thought 

I am using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [github pages][gh-pages] to make and host this blog. I do agree that it is pretty simple and straight forward. But still I messed up in the start. Nevertheless, its setup and all done for good. 

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. Also, you can follow any tutorial to get started.
