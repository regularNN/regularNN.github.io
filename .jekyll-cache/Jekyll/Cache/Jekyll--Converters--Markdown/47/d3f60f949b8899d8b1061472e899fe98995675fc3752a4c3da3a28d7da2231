I"¡<p>As the title says, this is my first ever blog. I have never been into writing. I do write codes and occasionally improvise documents of my friends but have never been into writing stuff from my mind.</p>

<p>This is my new experiment to which I remember I wanted to do from a very long time. I wish to write weekly blog about the things I read and things I feel to share.</p>

<p>To finish this quick short and first blog I would like to share the thought</p>

<p>I am using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> to make and host this blog. I do agree that it is pretty simple and straight forward. But still I messed up in the start. Nevertheless, its setup and all done for good.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll docs</a> for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. Also, you can follow any tutorial to get started.</p>
